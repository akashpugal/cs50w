## Apologies for Incomplete Course

I would like to apologize for not completing the course that I had originally intended to work on. Unfortunately, due to my hectic schedule and other commitments, I had to stop my studies midway. I deeply regret any inconvenience this may have caused.

## About the Course

The course I started was Web Programming with Python and JavaScript  offered by HARVARD's CS50.  I had high hopes of completing it, but circumstances prevented me from doing so.

## Future Plans

While I may not have been able to finish this particular course, I remain committed to my personal and professional development. I hope to return to my studies when my schedule permits and explore other opportunities for learning.

## Contact

If you have any questions or would like to connect with me, feel free to contact me through GitHub.

Again, I apologize for any inconvenience, and I appreciate your understanding.

Sincerely,
Akash Pugal
